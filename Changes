0.05  Sun Sep 21 15:17:16 PDT 2008
    Bug Fixes
    * methods now get the right name in caller(), not "Class::__ANON__".
    * The \@foo prototype no longer has a performance hit
    * Closures now work with \@foo
      (All the above thanks to Matthijs van Duin and his Sub::Name and
       Data::Alias)

    Test Fixes
    * Not rigorously checking the bitmask and hints flags from caller() as
      their behavior is undefined.  This fixes the 5.10 test failures.
