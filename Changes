    New Features
    * Data::Alias is no longer optional.  It's been fixed and is now
      maintained.  Aliasing will now always work.

    Misc
    * Use Const::Fast to implement read only arguments.  This avoids the
      optional Readonly::XS to make it fast.


20100730  Fri Jul 30 12:54:20 PDT 2010
    New Features
    * Added func() to handle functions.

    Incompatible Changes
    * Data::Alias is now optional.  This is because it does not work in 5.12
      and there's no fix in sight.  If you want to use aliasing in your
      distribution it will have to depend on Data::Alias itself.

    Docs
    * Updated the SEE ALSO
    * Removed the assertion that no checks are done on the signature

    Performance
    * Load PPI on demand to reduce load time (needed by perl5i)

    Other
    * Separated signature translation between methods and subroutines
      (needed by perl5i)


20081028  Tue Oct 28 00:45:48 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * Two or more slurpy parameters (ie. @foo or %bar) in a signature is
      an error.

    Bug Fixes
    * The debugger now works, thanks to an upgrade in Devel::Declare.
    * methods are now declared at compile time, like regular subs.

    Other
    * Added some simple example files.


20081021.1911  Tue Oct 21 19:11:47 PDT 2008
    Test Fixes
    * Used a new feature of Test::Builder, upgrade dependency.


20081021  Tue Oct 21 01:43:24 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * Checks for unspecified arguments
    * Almost anything can be used as a default.

    Bug Fixes
    * A default value with a comma in it is properly parsed.
    * Default values can now be any literal, even wacky things like q,Hi!,
    * The closing paren of a signature can now be on its own line.
    * The closing paren and the opening block can be on the same line.

    New Docs
    * Documented differences from Perl 6


20081008  Wed Oct  8 09:48:33 EDT 2008
    New Features
    * Named parameters have some basic compile-time error checks for illegal signatures.

    New Docs
    * Document restritions on named parameters.


20081007  Tue Oct  7 23:27:19 EDT 2008
    New Features
    * Added named parameters.

    Docs
    * Some documentation on what is not allowed, even if we don't
      yet check for it.
    * More thanks!
    * Add an example and comparision with regular Perl
    * Add some debugging tips


20081006  Mon Oct  6 02:24:36 EDT 2008
    New Features
    * Implemented "is alias", "is ro", "is rw" and "is copy".
    * Multiple traits supported "is copy is rw"
    * Implemented ! and ? (required and optional arguments)

    Bug Fixes
    * Stole some code from MooseX::Method::Signatures to make attributes
      parse better.  (thanks to Florian Ragwitz)

    Other
    - Repository moved to github.
    - Changing to ISO date versions.


0.11  Sat Sep 27 16:47:51 EDT 2008
    New Features
    * Added the "$arg!" required syntax (currently does nothing)
    * Attributes now work (thanks to mst)

    New Docs
    - Documented how to set a trait and a default
    * Document that earlier params may be used in defaults.
    * Document that @_ is left intact
    * Clarify aliased ref behavior
    * Document anonymous methods

    Bug Fixes
    * Protect against complicated default expressions


0.10  Sun Sep 21 20:04:41 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * Added "$class:" change the invocant a la Perl 6.
    * Added "$arg = EXPR" to set defaults.
    * Added "$arg?" optional param syntax (currently does nothing)
    * Added "$arg is foo" param traits (currently does nothing)
    * Expose a way to play with the prototype handler.

    Doc Fixes
    - Change "prototype" to "signature" to avoid confusion with Perl's
      built in prototypes.


0.05  Sun Sep 21 15:17:16 PDT 2008
    Bug Fixes
    * methods now get the right name in caller(), not "Class::__ANON__".
    * The \@foo prototype no longer has a performance hit
    * Closures now work with \@foo
      (All the above thanks to Matthijs van Duin and his Sub::Name and
       Data::Alias)

    Test Fixes
    * Not rigorously checking the bitmask and hints flags from caller() as
      their behavior is undefined.  This fixes the 5.10 test failures.


0.04  Sun Sep 21 13:52:29 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * A \@foo protototype allows you to use a reference as a regular var

    New Docs

0.03  Sun Sep 21 00:57:32 PDT 2008
    New Features
    * Eliminate the need of the trailing semicolon

    New Bugs
    * The debugger and one-liners are broken
